Viewing the original file was tedious and made it very difficult to locate what had been changed
Viewing the file using diff made it much easier to locate what had been changed and what needed to be corrected
By having different versions I can revert to a previous version of a program if I wanted to reverse the changes I made
I think Git allows mulitple files to be chaged in one commit since each change can affect all the files. With google Doc only the file you are updating is affected.

You can use git log and git diff to view history by comparing changes made from a commit and the previous commit
Knowing I can revert back to a prior commit allows me to program with confidance since if a mistake is made, I can go back to verify in which commit it occured in and what was the actual mistake was.
